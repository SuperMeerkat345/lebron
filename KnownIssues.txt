1) Doesn't translate process.argv correctly as (node testscript.js arg1) where arg1 is first arguement would say that (lebron -c testscript.lebron arg1) the first arguement is -c
May be able to fix in future updates.

2) When translating from js to lebron or vice versa, if you have a print statement that says:
'console.log("console.log is a function")' it will translate it to 'lebronSays("lebronSays is a function")'

This isn't a major issure here (even though it could be since no errors are raised), the program will still run.
The difficult part is if you have a variable like:

'lebronSaysGo = true' it will translate to  'console.logGo = true' which won't inherintely break the program immediately since
ALL instances of the variables would get translated, but it can get messy.
